This file lists the known ED bugs as of release 1.5.7:

1) Help screens may not display properly on screens if lines not equal 24.
   In particular, the additional subjects printed at the bottom may scroll the
   help text off the top of the screen.
2) Searching for <CR> (linebreak) will not be found on the last record in
   a buffer.
3) Mark spot/return to spot code between windows sometimes seems to go to
   the wrong spot.
4) Diredit of FTP software TCP/IP for DOS systems does not display year
   correctly.  Remote unix systems sometimes don't also.
5) ED built using Multinet TCP/IP for VMS does not seem to use TCP/IP.  Using a
   UCX version with the translation libraries does work on Multinet.
6) News Posting code is mostly untested, and does not work from VMS.
7) Top two headers in news posting code not valid for some news systems.
   Workaround:  delete them from the buffer before exiting.
8) mmap routine calls do not seem to work under Linux or BSD386 1.0 (null file).
   Workaround: edit config.h and add "#define NO_MMAP"
9) Diredit of NT to NT has sscanf problems, and shows \/ for directory.

List of potential enhancements (if you have an opinion, let me know):

1) Select range highlighting
2) Mouse support (click moves cursor, drag = select + move)
3) Speed up simple searches
4) Dired mode with a filter (ie -d *.for) 
5) Search failure should print a message instead of just beep (some terminals
   have the bell go dead).
6) Direct X support (superior keyboard mapping, fonts, etc).
7) On PC systems, make block cursor (instead of underline) an option.
8) On PC's, ALT alpha keys should be definable
9) Edit multiple files and keep one window open (ie keep window open on exit?)
10) Update window from modifications of grep window.
11) Support include file =buffname EDT syntax as open file window.
12) Store status on exit (extra enhanced bookmark?)
13) Easy way to pop open window to backup file
14) A friendly substitute command has been suggested.
15) Non-displaying buffer support is being considered.  So two files could be
   loaded and "toggle" between them (both full screen).


Bugs fixed and changes since V1.5.6:

- SHOW command with no parameters will cause editor to abort if executed in 
   a window with the bottom line less than 24 lines from the top of the screen.
- When accessing a VMS system file through FTP mode, the displayed file name
   may include the file name twice.  This prevents you from writing the file.
- Box paste positions the cursor at the lower right corner of the box after
   paste, while upper left corner would be more useful.
- Under DOS, OS/2, NT: editing a file with the syntax a:file.typ will fail.
   It will read the file correctly but cannot write the output file.  Specify
   a directory as a workaround.
- Trying to cancel defining a key by pressing CTRL-K (pressing CTRL-K
   twice with no characters inbetween) does not properly update the defined
   key status line.
- FTP mode with no file specified puts you in diredit mode for "/" on 
   remote unix systems; this should be your home directory.
- Combining environment variable substitution and wildcards did not work
   inside ED (this did not limit your shell's capabilities).  For example,
   ~/*.c didn't work.
- Editing * in a directory brings up . and .. while it would be much nicer
   if these were surpressed (except in diredit mode).
- VMS terminal size defaults for 0 0 sizing on command line braindead; it
   should just do a QIO and get the sizes.  For unix systems, should also 
   check symbols LINES and COLUMNS for defaults (xterm variables). 
   * Note: final implementation uses IOCTL calls to I/O subsystem.
- When using a backup directory (-kbackupdir) you cannot write/exit a file 
   if a directory name is specified in the file (ie not in default dir).
- Build problems on BSD386; make doesn't like include; IUCLC not defined;
   cuserid not in library.
- National Character Set does not work (enter/display 8 bit characters).
   V1.5.7 fix for display is a compile time option enabled by "#define USE_NCS"
- If additional qualifiers are on the command line with -n they are 
   passed as part of the news host name and it fails.
- Groups with upper case letters are not handled properly.
- Critical error handler on DOS cannot get input (reboot!)
- Define key message repaint problems if current window is closed.
- S/ or S / should be adequate for subs command line command.
- /../directory can cause wedges
- Root directory entries didn't display date properly on OS/2
- When entering a search string with a tab, sometimes (normal tabs) the
   cursor will not be properly positioned.
- Using wrong type of terminal configuration file (braindead on unix systems)
   can cause abort.
- Insert/overstrike indicator if -u specified; also for cut mode ?
- Should be an option to suppress the continuous File> prompt (-1 option).
- Clipboard support under Windows (Boyd request). (set ED_NUMLK=N to fix!)
- Set text/background color on NT (new image)
- Update of terminal *.ed files to set arrow mode (elm edit aliases fix)
- Provided a "LOAD" file with key definitions consistent with the default
   PC distribution bindings and added a few more keys, eg: ^A (ovr toggle), ^B
   (bigger), (gold o,m,c,d,s windows), gold b (box tog), gold x (calc & paste)
- Build problems on Solaris 2.x: provide custom makefile.solaris2
